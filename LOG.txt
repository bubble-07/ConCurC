5/14/2014 - Determined necessary structure for cells
5/15/2014 - Created the beginnings of "type.h", added "filter" to dynarray
5/16/2014 - Created "intersect" and "simplify" for "type.h"
5/20/2014 - Created simple test of typing functions.
5/21/2014 - Came up with better structures for cells, logistical work for AST conversion
5/22/2014 - Restructured project directories, added beginning of function_table
5/24/2014 - Added a really basic pass to collect function names
5/27/2014 - Added the beginnings of the function definition collection pass
5/28/2014 - Made it so to_cells adds to the global polymorph table
5/29/2014 - Added definition and methods associated with environments
5/30/2014 - Figured out what is necessary for translating the lexid_tree
6/01/2014 - Made type.h use lexids, added reordering pass
6/02/2014 - Lambda expressions now converted
6/04/2014 - Created cell_tree (different structure) and implemented bottom-up traversal

Goal: Interpreter lexes, parses, type-checks, and interprets some basic code by "semester" end.

Sub-goals:
Implement "toy" type-checker [from scratch, in-vitro]
Implement DAG conversion/lexical scoping
Integrate into language as full type-checker [type-annotate DAG]
Create primitive "eval" function handling core forms [get at least to here]
Extend with basic core library
Implement FFI mechanism
Implement FRP mechanism
Polish, extend core libraries, play, have fun
Publish

Short-term:
Change the definition of a type to be more consistent and accomodate parametric types

NOTE: Language should be renamed to "Phi" to avoid conflict with "Concur" -- 
will also make for a much cleaner logo (because it's just typographic)

Then, ensure that all public references [google-able] is to "phi-lang"
